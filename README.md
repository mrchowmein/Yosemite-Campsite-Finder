# Yosemite Campsite Finder

UPDATE FEB 28, 2019: NPS update their site, so this script needs to be updated to work.


This Python script is meant to facilitate campsite searching for Yosemite NP for a 2-week range. To run this script, you will need to install Beautiful Soup.

**Instructions:**
To use, run script and follow console instructions. Enter the date and campground name. The script will return available sites and dates.

**Non-Yosemite Campgrounds:**
To search other campgrounds available on recreation.gov, add new campgrounds and their respective IDs to the campGround dictionary.
